# Deep-Dive Insights

**Yearly Trends:**

From 2019 to 2022, the total sales amounted to approximately $28.1 million with over 100,000 orders processed. The year 2020 was the peak, contributing more than 35% of the total sales value with a record-high of $10.1 million. During this period, the average order value (AOV) reached around $300, the highest in the observed years.

However, since 2020, both sales and order volumes have been on a steady decline, with sales decreasing by approximately 10% in 2021 and a significant 46% drop in 2022. Despite these declines, the AOV has remained relatively stable, decreasing by only about 10% each year.

This trend suggests that the exceptional growth seen in 2020 was likely influenced by external factors such as enforced lockdowns and increased stimulus spending, which may have boosted consumer spending during that time. As these factors began to wane in 2021, the sales and order volumes gradually decreased.
